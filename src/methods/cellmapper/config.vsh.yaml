summary: "CellMapper is a general framework for k-NN based mapping tasks in single-cell and spatial genomics"
description: |
  k-NN-based mapping of cells across representations to tranfer labels, embeddings and expression values. 
  Works for millions of cells, on CPU and GPU, across molecular modalities, between spatial and non-spatial data, 
  for arbitrary query and reference datasets. We treat data denoising as self-mapping, were the query and reference datasets are the same.
