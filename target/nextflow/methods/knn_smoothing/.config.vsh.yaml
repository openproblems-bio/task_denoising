  summary: "Iterative kNN-smoothing denoises scRNA-seq data by iteratively increasing\
    \ the size of neighbourhoods for smoothing until a maximum k value is reached."
  description: "Iterative kNN-smoothing is a method to repair or denoise noisy scRNA-seq\
    \ expression matrices. Given a scRNA-seq expression matrix, KNN-smoothing first\
    \ applies initial normalisation and smoothing. Then, a chosen number of principal\
    \ components is used to calculate Euclidean distances between cells. Minimally\
    \ sized neighbourhoods are initially determined from these Euclidean distances,\
    \ and expression profiles are shared between neighbouring cells. Then, the resultant\
    \ smoothed matrix is used as input to the next step of smoothing, where the size\
    \ (k) of the considered neighbourhoods is increased, leading to greater smoothing.\
    \ This process continues until a chosen maximum k value has been reached, at which\
    \ point the iteratively smoothed object is then optionally scaled to yield a final\
    \ result."
